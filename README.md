# mxnet-notebooks
Docker build of Python 2.7, MxNet, and Jupyter Notebooks

# installation
 - clone repository
 - build image using ./build.sh
 - run image using ./run.sh  

After running the container, a web server will be mapped to port 8888 on your local host.  Access this web server using http://0.0.0.0:8888/  

After bringing the container up, you'll need to enter an access token generated by Jupyter in order to log into the Notebook server.  Run the command `docker logs mxnet-notebook` to see the access token.  

# usage
MXNet is preinstalled and can be used from a Python 2 environment by importing MxNet using `import mxnet as mx`
